collecting the common concept over different algorithm to a single file with reference

CRF + MEM + HMM together (and LR) maybe with some probability notes (Grpah Model summation***) Viterbi

Similarity Measurement + KMeans + ML Big Picture clustering

CRF + GraphicalModel + MLBigPicture

Maybe partial derivative derivation on some Jacobians (which are mentioned in CS224n Lecture 3)
