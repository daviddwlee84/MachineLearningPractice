# Distance / Similarity Measurement

## Basis

### Centroid

## Distance

### Euclidean Distance

> 歐幾里德距離（歐氏距離）

### Manhattan Distance

> 曼哈頓距離

### Chebyshev Distance

### Summary of Distance

## Norm

* [[數學分析] 淺談各種基本範數 (Norm)](https://ch-hsieh.blogspot.com/2010/04/norm.html)

### Lp Norm

> Lp範式

### Distance in Norm

* Euclidean Distance: P = 2
* Manhattan Distance: P = 1
* Chebyshev Distance: P = ∞

## Similarity

### Cosine Similarity

### Exponential Similarity

### Other Distance

#### Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-divergence)

> This is not a true metric because it does not obey triangle inequality

### Summary of Similarity

#### Similarity vs. Distance

Cosine Similarity is inversely proportional with Euclidean Distance

## Other Measurement

### From a Point to a Set

$$
\operatorname{dis}(x, A) = \frac{1}{|A|} ............ (haven't finish yet)
$$

### Distance between two sets

* Nearest distance between Set A and Set B
* Farthest distance between Set A and Set B
* Average distance between Set A and Set B
